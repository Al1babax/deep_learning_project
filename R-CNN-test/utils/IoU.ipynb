    "### Intersection over Union (IoU)\n",
    "This script will calculate the Intersection over Union (IoU) for two bounding boxes. The IoU is a measure of how much overlap there is between two bounding boxes on a single image. The IoU is calculated as the area of overlap divided by the area of union between two bounding boxes. The value of the IoU is a number between 0 and 1, with 1 representing perfect overlap and 0 representing no overlap. The IoU is used to determine if a proposed bounding box accurately describes an object in an image. The IoU is also used to determine if proposed bounding boxes accurately describe the same object in different images. The IoU is calculated as follows:\n",

    "IoU = \\frac{Area\\ of\\ Overlap}{Area\\ of\\ Union}\n",
