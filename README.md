# R-CNN project
School project for the course "Deep learning" at Jyväskylän ammattikorkeakoulu.
I decided to make multi-object detection project. The objective was to make model that could be used
to detect cars from livestream CCTV footage.

## Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.9 (Newer versions might work, but I haven't tested them)

After installing Python, you need to create two different virtual environments.
One of keras object detection and one for YOLOv5. Instructions to install both below.

**Important**
You have to install CUDA and cuDNN to your computer. I used CUDA 11.8.0 and cuDNN. I cannot guarantee
software working without these. Also, it makes software much faster.

### Keras object detection
Install requirements from keras_requirements.txt file. I recommend using virtual environment for this.
```
pip install -r keras_requirements.txt
```
### YOLOV5
Install requirements from yolov5_requirements.txt file. I recommend using virtual environment for this.
```
pip install -r yolov5_requirements.txt
```
